How to build the FreeType library on VMS
----------------------------------------

It is actually  very straightforward to install  the FreeType library.
Just execute `vms_make.com  from` the toplevel directory  to build the
library.  This procedure currently accepts the following options:

* `DEBUG`
  Build the library with debug information and without optimization.

* `lopts=<value>`
  Options to pass to the link command, e.g., `lopts=/traceback`.

* `ccopt=<value>`
  Options to pass to the C compiler, e.g., `ccopt=/float=ieee`.

In case you did download the demos, place them in a separate directory
sharing the same top level as the directory of FreeType and follow the
same  instructions as  above  for  the demos  from  there.  The  build
process relies  on this  to figure  out the  location of  the FreeType
include files.


To rebuild  the  sources it is necessary to  have MMS/MMK installed on
the system.

The library is available in the directory

  [.LIB]

To compile applications using FreeType  you have to define the logical
`FREETYPE` pointing to the directory

  [.INCLUDE.FREETYPE]

i.e., if the directory in which  this `INSTALL.VMS` file is located is
`$disk:[freetype.docs]`, then define the logical with

  define freetype $disk:[freetype.include.freetype]

See  http://nchrem.tnw.tudelft.nl/openvms/software2.html#Freetype  for
the packages FreeType depends on.

The latest versions were tested using
  - VSI C V7.4-002 and DECWindows V1.7-F on OpenVMS Alpha V8.4-2L1
  - VSI C V7.4-001 and DECWindows V1.7-E on OpenVMS IA64 V8.4-2L3
