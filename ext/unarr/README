unarr is a decompression library for RAR, TAR, ZIP and 7z archives.

unarr originated as a port of the RAR extraction features from
The Unarchiver project required for extracting images from comic
book archives (.cbr). It was written as an alternative to
libarchive which didn't have support for parsing filters or solid
compression at the time.

There is currently only an experimental Linux Makefile for building
unarr (see ../makefile.msvc for what SumatraPDF does under Windows).
In any case, compiling unarr should be as simple as compiling all
files with a C99 compatible compiler (omit main.c if you want to use
it as a library).

The following symbols can be defined if other libraries are present
in the include path:
