unarr is a decompression library for RAR, ZIP and 7z archives.

unarr originated as a port of the RAR extraction features from
The Unarchiver project required for extracting images from comic
book archives (.cbr). It was written as an alternative to
libarchive which didn't have support for parsing filters or solid
compression at the time.
