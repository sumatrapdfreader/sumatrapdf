Significant changes since 1.0.1
===============================

[1] Added emulation of the libjpeg v7 and v8b APIs and ABIs.  See
README-turbo.txt for more details.  This feature was sponsored by CamTrace SAS.

[2] Created a new CMake-based build system for the Visual C++ and MinGW builds.

[3] TurboJPEG/OSS can now compress from/decompress to grayscale bitmaps.

[4] jpgtest can now be used to test decompression performance only.

[5] If the default install prefix (/opt/libjpeg-turbo) is used, then
'make install' now creates /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib32 and
/opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib64 sym links to duplicate the behavior of the binary
packages.

[6] All symbols in the libjpeg-turbo dynamic library are now versioned, even
when the library is built with libjpeg v6b emulation.

[7] Added arithmetic encoding and decoding support (can be disabled via
configure or CMake options)

[8] TurboJPEG/OSS can now leverage the SIMD-accelerated color conversion
routines in libjpeg-turbo to generate planar YUV images from RGB input.


Significant changes since 1.0.0
===============================

[1] The Huffman decoder will now handle erroneous Huffman codes (for instance,
from a corrupt JPEG image.)  Previously, these would cause libjpeg-turbo to
crash under certain circumstances.

[2] Fixed typo in SIMD dispatch routines which was causing 4:2:2 upsampling to
be used instead of 4:2:0 when decompressing JPEG images using SSE2 code.

[3] configure script will now automatically determine whether the
INCOMPLETE_TYPES_BROKEN macro should be defined.


Significant changes since 0.0.93
================================

[1] 2983700: Further FreeBSD build tweaks (no longer necessary to specify
--host when configuring on a 64-bit system)

[2] Created sym. links in the Unix/Linux packages so that the TurboJPEG
include file can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/include, the 32-bit
static libraries can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib32, and the
64-bit static libraries can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib64.

[3] The Unix/Linux distribution packages now include the libjpeg run-time
programs (cjpeg, etc.) and man pages.

[4] Created a 32-bit supplementary package for amd64 Debian systems which
contains just the 32-bit libjpeg-turbo libraries.

[5] Moved the libraries from */lib32 to */lib in the i386 Debian package.

[6] Include distribution package for Cygwin

[7] No longer necessary to specify --without-simd on non-x86 architectures, and
unit tests now work on those architectures.


Significant changes since 0.0.91
================================

[1] 2982659, Fixed x86-64 build on FreeBSD systems

[2] 2988188: Added support for Windows 64-bit systems


Significant changes since 0.0.90
================================

[1] Added documentation to .deb packages

[2] 2968313: Fixed data corruption issues when decompressing large JPEG images
and/or using buffered I/O with the libjpeg-turbo decompressor
