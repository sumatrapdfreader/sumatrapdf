2.8.art Featured release
------------------------

Forked LCMS. This is binary incompatible with normal LCMS2.
Removed 'pickled' contexts.
Added explicit passing of cmsContextIDs to all API functions.
Removed the 'THR' API functions as now unnecessary.
Changed LCMS_VERSION (and checking logic).
Extend T_EXTRA etc to allow for 63 extra channels.

2.9 Maintenance release
-----------------------
Several fixes related with security, and therefore not detailed here.
C++ compiles now without warnings
