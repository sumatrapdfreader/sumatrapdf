- -fb switch now supports values up to 273
- The bug in 7z_C (7zIn.c) was fixed:
  It used Alloc/Free functions from different memory pools.

- Speed optimization of ANSI-C LZMA Decoder (now it's about 20% faster).
  Old version of LZMA Decoder now is in file LzmaDecodeSize.c. 
  LzmaDecodeSize.c can provide slightly smaller code than LzmaDecode.c

-------------------------
- More compatibility with some C++ compilers

-------------------------
- "Benchmark" command was added. It measures compressing 
  and decompressing speed and shows rating values. 
  Also it checks hardware errors.

-------------------------
- C++ LZMA Encoder/Decoder code now is more portable
  and it can be compiled by GCC on Linux.


4.01           2004-02-15
-------------------------
- Some detection of data corruption was enabled.

    .....
    {
      rd->ExtraBytes = 1;
      return 0xFF;
    }
