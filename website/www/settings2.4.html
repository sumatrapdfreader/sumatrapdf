<h2>Customizing SumatraPDF</h2>

<p>You can change the look and behavior of
<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/">SumatraPDF</a>
by editing the file <code>SumatraPDF-settings.txt</code>. The file is stored in
<code>%APPDATA%\SumatraPDF</code> directory for the installed version or in the
same directory as <code>SumatraPDF.exe</code> executable for the portable version.</p>

<p>Use the menu item <code>Settings -> Advanced Settings...</code> to open the settings file
with your default text editor.</p>

<p>The file is in a simple text format. Below is an explanation of
what the different settings mean and what their default values are.</p>

<p>Highlighted settings can't be changed from the UI. Modifying other settings
directly in this file is not recommended.</p>

<p>If you add or remove lines with square brackets, <b>make sure to always add/remove
square brackets in pairs</b>! Else you risk losing all the data following them.</p>

<h3 id="color">Syntax for color values</h3>

<p>
The syntax for colors is: <code>#rrggbb</code>.</p>
<p>The components are hex values (ranging from 00 to FF) and stand for:
<ul>
  <li><code>rr</code> : red component</li>
  <li><code>gg</code> : green component</li>
  <li><code>bb</code> : blue component</li>
</ul>
For example #ff0000 means red color. You can use <a href="http://www.colorpicker.com/">
Color Picker</a> or <a href="http://mudcu.be/sphere/">Sphere</a> or
<a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">ColorScheme Designer</a> to pick a color.
