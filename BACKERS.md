SumatraPDF is a free, open source project. Consider supporting it so that I can improve it in the future:

- [become a backer or sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sumatrapdf).
- [one-time donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/sumatrapdf)

A few words on Patreon membership levels.

If you're an individual who wants to support development of SumatraPDF, join $3/month level.

If you're a company that benefits from SumatraPDF (e.g. you use SumatraPDF in your company or ship SumatraPDF as part of your software), join $50/month Corporate Sponsor.

For $500/month you can become Platinum Sponsor. Support SumatraPDF and advertise your company. A link to your company will be put on SumatraPDF [home page](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/) as well as on start screen of SumatraPDF (starting with next version 3.3). This could be worth more than you're paying for.
