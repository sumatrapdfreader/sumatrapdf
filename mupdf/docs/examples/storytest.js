	+"<p>\"Just the place for a Snark!\" the Bellman cried,<br>"
	+"As he landed his crew with care;<br>"
	+"Supporting each man on the top of the tide<br>"
	+"By a finger entwined in his hair.</p>"

	+"<P>Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:<br>"
	+"That alone should encourage the crew.<br>"
	+"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:<br>"
	+"What I tell you three times is true.</p>"

	+"<p>The crew was complete: it included a Boots-<br>"
	+"A maker of Bonnets and Hoods-<br>"
	+"A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes-<br>"
	+"And a Broker, to value their goods.</p>"

	+"<p>A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,<br>"
	+"Might perhaps have won more than his share-<br>"
	+"But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,<br>"
	+"Had the whole of their cash in his care.</p>"

	+"<p>There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,<br>"
	+"Or would sit making lace in the bow:<br>"
	+"And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,<br>"
	+"Though none of the sailors knew how.</p>"

	+"<p>There was one who was famed for the number of things<br>"
	+"He forgot when he entered the ship:<br>"
	+"His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,<br>"
	+"And the clothes he had bought for the trip.</p>"
	+"<div id=\"a\">"
	+"<p>He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,<br>"
	+"With his name painted clearly on each:<br>"
	+"But, since he omitted to mention the fact,<br>"
	+"They were all left behind on the beach.</p>"
	+"</div>"

	+"<p>The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because<br>"
	+"He had seven coats on when he came,<br>"
	+"With three pair of boots-but the worst of it was,<br>"
	+"He had wholly forgotten his name.</p>"

	+"<p>He would answer to \"Hi!\" or to any loud cry,<br>"
	+"Such as \"Fry me!\" or \"Fritter my wig!\"<br>"
	+"To \"What-you-may-call-um!\" or \"What-was-his-name!\"<br>"
	+"But especially \"Thing-um-a-jig!\"</p>"

	+"<p>While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,<br>"
	+"He had different names from these:<br>"
	+"His intimate friends called him \"Candle-ends,\"<br>"
	+"And his enemies \"Toasted-cheese.\"</p>"

	+"<p>\"His form is ungainly-his intellect small-\"<br>"
	+"(So the Bellman would often remark)<br>"
	+"\"But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,<br>"
	+"Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.\"</p>"

	+"<p>He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare<br>"
	+"With an impudent wag of the head:<br>"
	+"And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,<br>"
	+"\"Just to keep up its spirits,\" he said.</p>"

	+"<p>He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late-<br>"
	+"And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad-<br>"
	+"He could only bake Bride-cake-for which, I may state,<br>"
	+"No materials were to be had.</p>"

	+"<p>The last of the crew needs especial remark,<br>"
	+"Though he looked an incredible dunce:<br>"
	+"He had just one idea-but, that one being \"Snark,\"<br>"
	+"The good Bellman engaged him at once.</p>"

	+"<p>He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,<br>"
	+"When the ship had been sailing a week,<br>"
	+"He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,<br>"
	+"And was almost too frightened to speak:</p>"

	+"<p>But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,<br>"
	+"There was only one Beaver on board;<br>"
	+"And that was a tame one he had of his own,<br>"
	+"Whose death would be deeply deplored.</p>"

	+"<div id=\"b\">"
	+"<p>The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,<br>"
	+"Protested, with tears in its eyes,<br>"
	+"That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark<br>"
	+"Could atone for that dismal surprise!</p>"
	+"</div>"

	+"<p style=\"-mupdf-leading:7pt;\">It strongly advised that the Butcher should be<br>"
	+"Conveyed in a separate ship:<br>"
	+"But the Bellman declared that would never agree<br>"
	+"With the plans he had made for the trip:</p>";

snark +="<p style=\"-mupdf-leading:11pt;\">Navigation was always a difficult art,<br>"
	+"Though with only one ship and one bell:<br>"
	+"And he feared he must really decline, for his part,<br>"
	+"Undertaking another as well.</p>"

	+"<p style=\"-mupdf-leading:15pt;\">The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure<br>"
	+"A second-hand dagger-proof coat-<br>"
	+"So the Baker advised it-and next, to insure<br>"
	+"Its life in some Office of note:</p>"

	+"<p style=\"-mupdf-leading:20pt;\">This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire<br>"
	+"(On moderate terms), or for sale,<br>"
	+"Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,<br>"
	+"And one Against Damage From Hail.</p>"

	+"<p style=\"-mupdf-leading:30pt;\">Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,<br>"
	+"Whenever the Butcher was by,<br>"
	+"The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,<br>"
	+"And appeared unaccountably shy.</p>"
