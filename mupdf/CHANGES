List of changes on master since MuPDF 1.2

 * Windows RT viewer app for MuPDF.
 * Library changes to support progressive loading (display PDF files as
   they download). Windows/Linux/MacOS viewer supports this using curl.
 * Incremental updates to PDF files are now (optionally) preserved on
   loading/saving.
 * Prototype support for checking PDF Digital Signatures.
 * Initial annotation support (strike-out, underline, highlight and ink)
   (library and android builds only).
 * Fix operation on Android API level 8.
 * Android redraw optimisations.
 * Android app now supports Google Cloud Print.
 * Android app translated into many languages.
 * Android support for more architectures.
 * Improvements to store (avoid collisions causing unnecessary evictions).
 * Windows apps use Unicode filenames now.
 * PDF function handling improved; functions can now be passed to devices
   without 'sampling'.
 * PDF image handling improved; images can now be passed to devices
   without decompression.
 * Indexed images are no longer uncompressed at load time, saving memory.
 * Caching of rendered tiles for speed.
 * Improved text analysis mode, capable of spotting columns/indents,
   right-to-left text etc.
 * HTML output mode now includes image output.
 * PDF password encoding handling improved.
 * MuPDF now opens Jpeg, Tiff and PNG files directly.
 * Bug preventing OpenXPS files from being opened fixed.
 * Initial (feature incomplete) SVG and PDF output devices.
 * PWG raster (mono/grey/RGB) and PCL (mono) output devices.
 * Various performance improvements (including tilings and mesh based
   shadings).
 * Revamped directory structure to reflect recent changes.
 * Various potential SEGV, SoftMask and rendering fixes.
 * Many potential crashes in Jpeg2000 and JBIG2 images fixed.


List of changes on master since MuPDF 1.1

 * Important API changes:
    * fz_bbox is now fz_irect.
    * APIs (including fz_device) now pass fz_rect/fz_matrix by reference.
    * fz_device API is now more consistent with regards to use of
      fz_rect rather than fz_bbox.
 * Add support for Javascript and forms handling.
 * Fix many SEGVs with out of spec files. Many thanks to Mateusz "j00ru"
   Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind of the Google Security team, zeniko,
   Sebastian Rasmussen and all other contributors.
 * Add fz_open_document_with_stream to allow non-file based operation.
 * Move to using git submodules for third party libraries.
 * Much enhanced Android application. Now on Google Play!
 * Oversized and stroke text clipping implemented.
 * Change shadings to decompose at render times; massive memory savings.
 * Renamed 'mubusy' to 'mutool'.
 * PDF 1.7 Extension Level 8 encryption implemented.
 * Added consts to various parts of the API to help C++ interworking.
 * Prototype transition support.
 * Text searching API moved to fitz.
 * Highlight and copy text selections.
 * Performance enhancements for color conversion and fax decompression.
 * ARM optimisations for color conversion and bitmap scaling.
 * Bitmap subsampling stage introduced, with ARM optimisations.
 * Type 3 fonts; glyphs are now handled as display lists.
 * Scan converter performance improvements.
 * Various rendering fixes.


List of changes on master since MuPDF 1.0

 * Rendering bugs fixed (text clipping, stroked text etc).
 * Better handling of 'large' (uncachable) glyphs.
 * Added a delete button to the library view on the iOS port.
 * Minor speed optimisations.
 * Shading bug fixes.
 * Move to using dynamically allocated parsing buffers (more resilient).
 * Support for UserUnits.
 * Fix bugs with image predictors (including with 16 bit images).
 * More resilient to out of spec files.
 * Extract pdf writing capability into the library from pdfclean, and
   expand on it to allow for linearisation. Bug fixes in the garbage
   collection of unused objects.
 * Improve pdf writing recognition of images.
 * Improved font matching.
 * Start to move away from macros to inline functions (helpful for
   applications requiring certification).
 * Many bugs fixed.
