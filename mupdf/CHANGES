		JSON parser, object model, and printer.

		Activity logger API.

		Support "overlong null" characters in utf-8 (using "\xC0\x80"

		Removed bit-rotted sections of the Makefile that have not been
		maintained and no longer work (primarily iOS and MinGW).

		mutool show: new option -r (force repair)

		mutool clean: --structure=keep to keep tagged content when
		subsetting pages. WARNING: This option will prevent the file
		from shrinking, because we must still keep all the objects from
		deleted pages around.

		mutool clean: -t option will always write compact objects
		mutool clean: -tt option will always pretty-print objects

		You must call pdf_report_error in the final fz_catch. Any
		unreported errors will be automatically reported when a new
		error is raised, or when closing the fitz context.


	New formats:

		Read Office (XML) files! We internally open and convert
		docx/pptx/xlsx documents to HTML to allow reading the plain

	Major bug fixes and improvements:

		Support using Art, Bleed, Media, and Trim boxes for PDF page
		size.

		Support ActualText in PDF! No more strange text extraction when
		the file uses ActualText to patch over bad font encodings.

		Add special TrueType fallback encoding CMap for a specific
		flavor of broken PDF files that use an "identity" encoding
		without embedding the font.

		Limited "transfer function" support in PDF. Transfer functions
		are a deprecated legacy PDF feature that predates proper color
		management. They were intended to provide limited color
		management such as applying a gamma curve. Transfer functions
		have often been (ab)-used to invert images, and many PDF
		creators use them when writing softmask images. We have added
		support for this case only.

		Box drawing characters added to fonts for HTML and plain text
		documents.

		Write more compact PDF files (removed some unneccessary
		whitespace).

		of RTL text in PDF.

		and which are not).

		Improved content type detection. Don't assume everything is PDF
		when we can't recognize it.

	Removed deprecated functions:
		pdf_check_signature
