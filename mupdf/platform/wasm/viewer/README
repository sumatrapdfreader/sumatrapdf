The MuPDF WASM Viewer
=====================

This project contains a very simple demo of how to create
a PDF viewer in the browser using the MuPDF WASM Library.

IMPORTANT:

You CANNOT run this from the file system!

Modern web browsers refuse to load and run scripts from the file system, so
this project must be served up by a web server.

In the platform/wasm directory start a stand-alone web server:

	mupdf/platform/wasm $ python -m http.server

Then open a browser:

	firefox http://localhost:8000/viewer/mupdf-view.html
