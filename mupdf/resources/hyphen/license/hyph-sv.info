% changes:
%     - 1991-01-08: First version available for anonymous FTP.
%     - 1991-08-08: Changed \aa to \aa0 at end of line, to stop TeX from
%           concatenating the patterns.
%     - 1991-09-03: Cleaned up lots of inconsistencies in the dictionary.
%           As a consequence, the patterns shrunk a lot.  Also added some 4000
%           one-syllable words, some of which were hyphenated by the old
%           patterns, and some 1500 compound words, about half of which were
%           incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
%     - 1991-11-01: Added another some 6200 compound words, all of which were
%           incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
%     - 1991-11-13: Added another some 6500 compound words, all of which were
%           incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
%     - 1992-01-30: Changed macros to ^^, for use with LaTeX and dc fonts.
%     - 1994-03-03: The hyphenated dictionary now contains about 118,000 words.
%           The hyphenation now works much better for compound words.
%           Patgen parameters 1 2 20, 2 1 8, 1 4 7, 3 2 1, 1 10000 4.

% ==========================================
% These hyphenation patterns work quite well for simple words, but not
% quite as well for compound words.  I'm working on improving the quality,
% by adding more words.  If you know any Swedish words which are not
% correctly hypheneted using these patterns, or if you have questions or
% comments, please contact me:
