%         Hyphenation patterns for Russian in T2A and UTF-8 encodings.
%         For 8-bit engines, the 'ruhyphen' package provides a number of
%         different pattern sets, as well as different (8-bit) encodings, that
%         can be chosen at format-generation time.  The UTF-8 version only
%         provides the default pattern set.  A mechanism similar to the one used
%         for 8-bit patterns may be implemented in the future.
% ==========================================
% Patterns were generated with patgen from a 990,000-word list and then
% manually corrected.
%
% The program consists of the files ruhyphal.tex, cyryoal.tex and two
% document files README.ruhyphal and hyphen.rules.  The file cyryoal.tex
% can be regenerated using mkcyryo script (a part of ruhyphen package)
% and the latest release of rus-ispell dictionaries
% <ftp://scon155.phys.msu.su/pub/russian/ispell/>.

% Additional patterns with hyphen/dash: a hack to prevent breaking after hyphen, but not before.
