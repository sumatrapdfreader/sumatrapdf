%     - The first version of the patterns was developed
%           by Hanna Kołodziejska (1987).
%     - The adaptation to the LeX format (see below) and extensive modification
%           were done by Bogusław Jackowski & Marek Ryćko (1987--1989).
%     - The hyphenation rules were further improved and adapted to the
%           TeX 3.x requirements by Hanna Kołodziejska (1991).
%     - Lone-standing version (3.0a) of patterns was prepared (under pressure
%           from LaTeX users) by Bogusław Jackowski and Marek Ryćko, following
%           Mariusz Olko's suggestions, 1995.
%     - The LeX format mentioned above was the first version of the adaptation
%           of TeX to the Polish language. The next version is called MeX.
