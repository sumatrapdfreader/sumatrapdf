%         Hyphenation patterns for Turkish in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
%         Auto-generated from a script included in the distribution.
%         The patterns for Turkish were first produced for the Ottoman Texts
%         Project in 1987 and were suitable for both Modern Turkish and Ottoman
%         Turkish in Latin script, however the required character set didn't fit
%         into EC encoding, so support for Ottoman Turkish had to be dropped to
%         keep compatibility with 8-bit engines.

% Differences with Ottoman patterns:
% - adapted for the use on modern TeX engines, using UTF-8 charactes
% - only letters for Modern Turkish + âîû (the first one often needed, the other two don't hurt)
% - (if needed, support for Ottoman Turkish might be provided separately under language code 'ota')
%
% prohibit hyphen before vowels, allow after
% allow hyphen either side of consonants
% prevent e-cek at end of word
% prohibit hyphen before pair of consonants
% many pairs generated here are impossible anyway
% allow hyphen between vowels, but not after second vowel of pair
% several phonetically impossible pairs here
% a couple of consonant-clusters
