%         Hyphenation patterns for Afrikaans in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
%         OpenOffice includes older patterns created by a different author,
%         but the patterns packaged with TeX are considered superior in quality.
% ==========================================
% These patterns were generated with Opatgen from a lexicon
% of 183 000 syllabified Afrikaans words.
%
% Define lefthyphenmin to one and righthyphenmin to two
% (although righthyphenmin could technically be made one,
%  in almost all cases a value of two gives better results)
