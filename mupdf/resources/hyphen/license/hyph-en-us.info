% ==========================================
%
% ushyphmax.tex -- patterns for more hyphenation pattern memory (12000+).
% Also known as ushyphen.max.
%
% Needs extended pattern memory.
% Hyphenation trie becomes 7283 with 377 ops.
%
% These patterns are based on the Hyphenation Exception Log
% published in TUGboat, Volume 10 (1989), No. 3, pp. 337-341,
% and a large number of incorrectly hyphenated words not yet published.
% If added to Liang's before the closing bracket } of \patterns,
% the patterns run errorfree as far as known at this moment.
%
% These patterns find all admissible hyphens of the words in
% the Exception Log.  ushyph2.tex is a smaller set.
%
% Please send bugs or suggestions to tex-live (at) tug.org.
%
% 2005-05-30 (karl): in the past, ushyphmax.tex was a file containing
% only the additional patterns, without the \patterns command, etc.
% This turned out not to be very useful, since in practice the TeX
% distributions need one self-contained file for a language.  Therefore,
% ushyphmax.tex now contains both the additional patterns from
% Dr. Kuiken, and the original patterns and hyphenations from Knuth's
% hyphen.tex.
%
% The Plain TeX hyphenation tables.
% hyphen.tex patterns end here, and additional patterns begin:
% end of additional patterns.
% DEK's hyphenation exception list, from hyphen.tex; not changed.
