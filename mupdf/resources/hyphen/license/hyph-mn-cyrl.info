% ==========================================
% Special thanks to: Jim Hefferon and Robin Fairbairns
%
% There are few basic rules in mongolian
%
% 1. If there is a consonant then it can use hyphen before it.
%    And if there're two consonants then it can use hyphen before second consonant.
%    Are there three consonants then it can put hyphen before third consonant,
%    also are there four consonants then it can use hyphen before fourth consonant.
% 2. In the case of hardsign or softsign, it's possible to hyphen after these signs.
%    For instance, байгуулъ-я, үзүүль-е
% 3. However one vowel can be belong to a syllable, it's not possible to use hyphen.
