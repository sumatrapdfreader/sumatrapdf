ABOUT

MuPDF is a lightweight PDF, XPS and CBZ viewer and parser/rendering library.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. We support PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, search and many other bells
and whistles. MuPDF can also read XPS documents (OpenXPS / ECMA-388),
and CBZ (Comic Book archive) files.

MuPDF is written to be both modular and portable; the example applications
are merely thin layers on top of the functionality offered by the library,
so custom viewers can be easily built for a wide range of platforms. Example
viewer applications are supplied for Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.

MuPDF is deliberately designed to be threading library agnostic, while still
supporting multi-threaded operation. In the absence of a thread library
it will run single-threaded, but by adding one significant benefits in
rendering speed on multi-core platforms can be obtained.

Interactive features such as form filling, javascript and transitions
are in development and partially supported by the Android application.

freetype2, jbig2dec, libjpeg, openjpeg, and zlib. These libraries are contained
in the source archive. If you are using git, they are included as git
submodules.

DOWNLOAD

The latest development source is available directly from the git repository:

	git clone http://mupdf.com/repos/mupdf.git

In the mupdf directory, update the third party libraries:

	git submodule update --init

INSTALLING (UNIX)

Typing "make prefix=/usr/local install" will install the binaries, man-pages,
static libraries and header files on your system.
