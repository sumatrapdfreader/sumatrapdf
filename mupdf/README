ABOUT

MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. MuPDF renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF has a small footprint. A binary that includes the standard Roman fonts is only one megabyte. A build with full CJK support (including an Asian font) is approximately five megabytes.

MuPDF has support for all non-interactive PDF 1.7 features, and the toolkit provides a simple API for accessing the internal structures of the PDF document. Example code for navigating interactive links and bookmarks, encrypting PDF files, extracting fonts, images, and searchable text, and rendering pages to image files is provided.

PREREQUISITES

Before compiling MuPDF you need to install thirdy party dependencies.

	zlib
	libjpeg
	freetype2

There are a few optional dependencies that you don't strictly need.

	jbig2dec
	OpenJPEG

MuPDF uses the Perforce Jam build tool. You need the Perforce version 2.5
or later. FTJam will also work. If you do not have a compiled
binary for your system, you can find the Jam and FTJam web sites here:

	http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html
	http://www.freetype.org/jam/index.html

I use Mingw and MSYS to compile for Windows. If you use anything
else, you are on your own.

COMPILING

If all of that is installed, compiling should be a cinch.
Issue the command 'jam' in the root of the project directory.
Add a parameter '-sBUILD=release' or '-sBUILD=profile' to
build release or profile versions.

	$ jam '-sBUILD=release'

If the build fails because it cannot find header files or libraries,
look first in Jamrules to see if there is anything wrong with the
search paths or compiler flags for your system.

To compile in the optional jbig2 and jpeg2000 support, you need
to add the following arguments to jam:

	$ jam '-sHAVE_JBIG2DEC=yes' '-sHAVE_OPENJPEG=yes'

If you want a crippled version without the builtin CJK fonts and data files,
to shave a few megabytes off the binary size, add:

	$ jam '-sDEFINES=NOCJK'

DOWNLOAD

The latest development source is available directly from the darcs repository.
Browse the source or use the following command line to check out the source:

    darcs get http://ccxvii.net/repos/mupdf

INSTALLING

There is no install. Just copy the resulting binary from the build
directory to a directory in your path.
