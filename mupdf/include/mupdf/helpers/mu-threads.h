/*
	Simple threading helper library.
	Includes implementations for Windows, pthreads,
	and "no threads".

	The "no threads" implementation simply provides types
	and stub functions so that things will build, but abort
	if we try to call them. This simplifies the job for
	calling functions.

	To build this library on a platform with no threading,
	define DISABLE_MUTHREADS (or extend the ifdeffery below
	so that it does so).

	To build this library on a platform that uses a
	threading model other than windows threads or pthreads,
	extend the #ifdeffery below to set MUTHREAD_IMPL_TYPE
	to an unused value, and modify mu-threads.c
	appropriately.
