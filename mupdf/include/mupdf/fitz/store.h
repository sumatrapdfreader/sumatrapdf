/**
	Resource store

	MuPDF stores decoded "objects" into a store for potential reuse.
	If the size of the store gets too big, objects stored within it
	can be evicted and freed to recover space. When MuPDF comes to
	decode such an object, it will check to see if a version of this
	object is already in the store - if it is, it will simply reuse
	it. If not, it will decode it and place it into the store.

	All objects that can be placed into the store are derived from
	the fz_storable type (i.e. this should be the first component of
	the objects structure). This allows for consistent (thread safe)
	reference counting, and includes a function that will be called
	to free the object as soon as the reference count reaches zero.

	Most objects offer fz_keep_XXXX/fz_drop_XXXX functions derived
	from fz_keep_storable/fz_drop_storable. Creation of such objects
	includes a call to FZ_INIT_STORABLE to set up the fz_storable
	header.

/**
	The store can be seen as a dictionary that maps keys to
	fz_storable values. In order to allow keys of different types to
	be stored, we have a structure full of functions for each key
	'type'; this fz_store_type pointer is stored with each key, and
	tells the store how to perform certain operations (like taking/
	dropping a reference, comparing two keys, outputting details for
	debugging etc).

	The store uses a hash table internally for speed where possible.
	In order for this to work, we need a mechanism for turning a
	generic 'key' into 'a hashable string'. For this purpose the
	type structure contains a make_hash_key function pointer that
	maps from a void * to a fz_store_hash structure. If
	make_hash_key function returns 0, then the key is determined not
	to be hashable, and the value is not stored in the hash table.

	Some objects can be used both as values within the store, and as
	a component of keys within the store. We refer to these objects
	as "key storable" objects. In this case, we need to take
	additional care to ensure that we do not end up keeping an item
	within the store, purely because its value is referred to by
	another key in the store.

	An example of this are fz_images in PDF files. Each fz_image is
	placed into the	store to enable it to be easily reused. When the
	image is rendered, a pixmap is generated from the image, and the
	pixmap is placed into the store so it can be reused on
	subsequent renders. The image forms part of the key for the
	pixmap.

	When we close the pdf document (and any associated pages/display
	lists etc), we drop the images from the store. This may leave us
	in the position of the images having non-zero reference counts
	purely because they are used as part of the keys for the
	pixmaps.

	We therefore use special reference counting functions to keep
	track of these "key storable" items, and hence store the number
	of references to these items that are used in keys.

	When the number of references to an object == the number of
	references to an object from keys in the store, we know that we
	can remove all the items which have that object as part of the
	key. This is done by running a pass over the store, 'reaping'
	those items.

	Reap passes are slower than we would like as they touch every
	item in the store. We therefore provide a way to 'batch' such
	reap passes together, using fz_defer_reap_start/
	fz_defer_reap_end to bracket a region in which many may be
	triggered.
