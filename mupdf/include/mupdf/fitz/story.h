	This header file provides an API for laying out and placing styled
	text on a page, or pages.

	First a text story is created from some styled HTML.

	Next, this story can be laid out into a given rectangle (possibly
	retrying several times with updated rectangles as required).

	Next, the laid out story can be drawn to a given device.

	In the case where the text story cannot be fitted into the given
	areas all at once, these two steps can be repeated multiple
	times until the text story is completely consumed.

	Finally, the text story can be dropped in the usual fashion.
