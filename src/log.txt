2021-06-08 Tue

improving code to preview crashes

2021-06-07 Mon

don't pre-populate annotation content when creating it from text
mupdf does that but not sure if that was the right behavior

2021-06-06 Sun

ask to save annotations when closing a window (fixes #1962)
https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1962

show that a document has unsaved annotations in the toolbar (fixes #1973)
https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1973

2021-06-05 Sat

fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1970
a crash when pressing 'q' on empty window. a regression from
recent change.
lesson: more testing even when making seemingly simple changes

updates keyboard shortcuts docs, formatted .html files with prettier
(will be easier to review diffs after notion import in the future).

optimized TocItem::ChildAt() for https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1795#issuecomment-855295881
this document is somewhat of an edge case in that it has toc items with
lots of children and ChildAt(n) would always traverse from first child,
creating a quadratic time complexity.
still not fast enough for this particular document but at least now
the time is spent fully in windows TreeCtrl code.

website: make display of keyboard shortcut in manual.html look closer to docs/Keyboard-shortcuts.html

speedup PopulateTreeItem (fixes #1795)
https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1795
the trick was to insert children in reverse order, as per
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20111125-00/?p=9033

speed up TreeCtrl::GetTreeItemByHandle()

speed up TreeCtrl::GetHandleByTreeItem() by storing handle in TreeItem

website: fix broken links

possibly speed up Vec::EnsureCap()

disable TocEditor, New Bookmarks etc.

randomize viewing state during stress test

2021-05-30 Sun

always enable opening text files
previously we would only open .txt files if advanced setting
"open ebooks with mupdf engine" was true.

replace NotificationGroupId with Kind

convert enum NotificationOptions to enum class

2021-05-29 Sat

Refactor StressTest: convert most method to functions.

Remove ImgFormat because it's redundant with kindFile*

Tweak detection of clang-format.exe and msbuild.exe so that
we consistently start with 2019 Preview.

stress testing: limit number of rendered pages per file to 32 randomly
picked pages. This speeds up stress testing by avoiding rendering really
big documents. 

2021-05-28 Fri

In 3.2 I introduced a regression: when user changed pages I tried to sync
the treeview selection to match the current page. In 3.1.2 we would limit
auto-select to currently expanded items. In 3.2 we would auto-expand
tree item to make selected tree item visible.
Fixed it in https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/4960ce53950bd9d50500c4141b41b7d4839dc767

The TreeCtrl / TreeModel still has problems.

1. To make things efficient TreeItem shouldn't be a class but an
opaque pointer-sized handle and it's items should belong to
TreeModel. This would allow us to potentially optimize how we store
information. Currently we have to create TreeItem object for
every node.

2. Changes to TreeCtrl are not reflected in TreeModel. Maybe
they shouldn't but then we should be more clear about it
in the code.

Folded premake5.opt.lua into premake5.lua. When changing flags
in premake5.lua I would always forget to update premake5.opt.lue
Now relevant projects are close together and in the same file
so maybe less mistakes in the future.

---

On a treemodel branch, redid TreeModel interface, by folding TreeItem
methods into it. This is to open possibility for more efficient implementation
of TreeModel. Even now the code should be a bit smaller by removing methods
from what were TreeItem subclasses.

---

Links to /settings3.3.html and /settings/settings3.3.html were broken because
Cloudflare Pages doesn't handle HTML files with '.' in the name.
Had to change naming scheme to /settings/settings3-3.html

---

Fixed Notion HTML generation to not generate files with '.' in them.



2021-05-27 Thu

Added support for .xps files with jpeg-xr images in them.
mupdf has code that uses open-source jpeg-xr library but we used
to have decoder that used Windows built-in codec. This got lost
during the big mupdf merge.
I resurrected this code and tweak it a bit.
https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/0d5ae4e28120fe563970ef66c1e92f2cc6bfa113
https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/b16fda12776c223a901efee2afdacbd953671df0

Fixed building on GitHub Actions caused by msbuild changes in
Visual Studio 2019 Preview.
In the past "msbuild /t:test_util" worked just fine.
In latest it has to be "msbuild /t:test_util:Rebuild".
No idea why ":Rebuild" (also tried just ":Build" but it didn't work).

fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1730

annotations: don't change page position when annotation is created

updated mupdf to latest version

2020-07-26 Sun

Started on converting tab code into TabCtrl.
Luckily can do it step-by-step.

refactoring old code. Changed some settings from wstr to str.
change DisplayMode to enum class.

2020-07-25 Sat

fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1286
'i' would show page number only temporarily (persistently with SHIFT)
and only in full screen.
Make it work always and toggle the info.
It could be improved (no close button, don't dismiss with ESC like
other notification windows, no flickering of notification window).

fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1711
(and https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1454 most likely).
When the cache of rendered pages is full, we free a page. If we happened to
free a page from the document in the current tab, it would lead to free / re-rerender
cycle and flickering.
The fix is to make sure we only free from other tabs.
Not perfect (if it's a visible tab in a different window, we'll probably flicker).
The right approach would be to make the cache expand in FreeIfFull()
if we can't find invisible page to drop (e.g. by using linked list
to store cache entries or by having e.g. 256 over-flow entries).

fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1712
Lots of debugging but the root cause was simple: notifications window
is a child of canvas window. it was flickering because a paint of
canvas would paint over notification window.
Fixed by telling canvas window to clip children.
We should make it more flexible and more efficient to add stuff to be
drawn on canvas.

2020-07-10 Fri

handle pdf_annot_author() throwing (fixes #1673)

don't crash when trying to restore deleted file (fixes #1674)
it was a regression from the fix for saving preferences.
probably not the best fix, should fix the fact that prefs::Save()
deletes gGlobalPrefs->sessionData while 're iterating on it

limit which annotations can be moved

refactor dragging logic a bit

make ESC cancel dragging of an annotation

show rect of selected annotation in annotation editor

2020-07-09 Thu

fix regression of not copying rectangular selection as image (fixes #1668)

write DisplayModel::GetAnnotationAtPos(Point) and EngineGetAnnotationAtPos(Engine, Point)

update annotation rect after it's moved

2020-07-08 Wed

Parallelized doit -clang-format. Go concurrency is a joy.

implement EnginePdfHasUnsavedAnnotations() and bug-fix detection
of when to show 'Save PDF' button in annotations editor.

update mupdf.
this was a big one because mupdf switched to using gumbo
as html/xml parser.

tweak premake definitions

ask to save unsaved annotation when closing a pdf file

2020-07-07 Tue

Added creation of highlight, squiggly, strikeout and underline
annotations.

Replaced EnginePdf::IsLinearizedFile() with mupdf's pdf_doc_was_linearized.
It didn't exist when IsLinearizedFile() was written.
Removing code feels good.

2020-07-06 Mon

Fixed a bunch of issues related to bugs in freetype and not
compiling Sumatra with the exact same freetype options as mupdf.
Introduced when I updated freetype code.

Removed .smx support. It's a lot of work to add support for all
PDF annotations (for each annotation type need to write code
to serialize it, de-serialize it, draw the annotation for
each engine type).
It's also sumatra-only and I suppose the majority of people
just want PDF annotations.
Might resurrect if there's a lot of requests for it.

2020-07-05 Sun

Link to the commit on pre-release and daily build pages.

Fixed a long-standing issue of loosing list of opened files
if Sumatra crashes or get killed by Windows (e.g. due to restart).
Took so long to fix becaue I believed the code is correct.
Turns out prefs::Save() was haphzardly used. It's still
not great but at least this specific error is fixed.
To be even more robust we should periodically (every 5 min?)
call prefs::Save(). We only do it after opening and closing a file,
which means that if we scroll etc., we'll loose this info.

Coding style refactorings: change enum SettingType to enum class,
change SerializeStruct() and SerializeGlobalPrefs() to return std::span<u8>.

Fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/1661
Another example of broken PDF that can be better handled if we
relax parsing of PDF (cmap).

Fixed https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/651
Managing focus is tricky.

2020-07-04 Sat

Improving WStr the same way as Str, while we're in this area.

make ByteWriter manage it's own buffer. In retrospect it's
better API than passing a buffer.

2020-07-03 Fri

De-templetizing WStr implementation. Currently it's a subclass
of Vec<WCHAR>.
Yes, duplication of code is bad but so are templates.
Reading code where you see T instead of WCHAR is significantly
worse.
The more stuff there is in .h files, the more code uses
templates, the longer are compilation times.
Templated code must be in .h file. 
While I can't fix long compilation times, I can try to keep
them as fast as possible.
Also an opportunity to make the API smaller.

Optimized str::Str on 64-bit by changing type of len/cap from
size_t to u32.

---

Optimizing Str. Turns out that after de-templatizing the code
became easier to understand and opportunities for optimizations
turn up.
The optimizations are pretty nasty (re-using the same memory for
more than one purpse) but worth doing for such a fundamental type.

2020-06-29 Mon
