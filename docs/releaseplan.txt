Major user-visible changes in each release:
2.3 - text support (in it's own ui)
2.4 - hex display (can show any file in hex/text view; it's own ui)

More detailed list for 2.3:
- refactor LoadDocument() so that more code is shared between
  engine/ebook UIs and so that it loads documents in the
  background thread
- a smoother transition betwen different window types which
  doesn't involve closing the window
- closing last ebook window via 'x' if it has opened document
  leaks memory
- ???

It's best to make the most risky (most likely to introduce breakage) changes
first so that there is time to stabilize the code. E.g. in 2.2, LoadDocument()
refactoring is such a change.
